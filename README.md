Zaio Technical Interviews coding challenges

## Question 1 
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print 'Fizz' instead of the number and for the multiples of five print 'Buzz'. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print 'FizzBuzz'.

## Question 2 
Reverse a string. You can not use the python string slicing method which is string = string[::-1].

## Question 3
Print the times table for a given number. For example if given 8, the program should print the 8 times table. 

## Question 4
Write a function that computes the list of the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. As an example, here are the first 10 Fibonnaci numbers: 0,1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34.

## Question 5
Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, determine whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array where nums[i] = nums[j] and the absolute difference between i and j is less than or equal to k.

## Question 6
Given an array of n distinct elements, find the minimum number of swaps required to sort the array.
